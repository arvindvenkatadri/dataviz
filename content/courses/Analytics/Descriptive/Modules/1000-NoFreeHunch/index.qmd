## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #1: Guys have more pocket money than Gals
::: callout-important
{{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Guys carry more cash than Gals. 
:::
Have you got money? Open your wallet and show me how much. Guys and Gals. 
Will this work in these UPI days? And well-dressed Gals don't have pockets in their clothing, Uncle...
So then ask **"How much did you spend today?"** Again, Guys and Gals. 

And then a two independent sample test for means. And Permutation and all that stuff.

## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #2: I will eat my tip, thank you. 

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} The average tip people give is higher for people who are non-vegetarians. Regardless of whether you are [going Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Dutch) or not.
:::

Are vegetarians more kanjoos? Or it is the meat-eaters?

So Swiggy/Zomato/Dining Out bills. For both sets of people. And then the t-t-t-t-t-test...

## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #3: Art, Design, and Vocation are all diff-different. 

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Grades are very different between B.Voc, B.Cra, and B.Des folks. 
:::

So? Grades of course, for a good sample from all *three* groups of people..and then?
ANOVA of course. 

## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #4: Chhota Bheem vs Doraemon vs Dragon Tales

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Doraeomon >> Dragon Tales >> Chhota Bheem!
:::
The [**Anywhere Door**](https://doraemon.fandom.com/wiki/Anywhere_Door) makes Doraemon the greatest children's show on earth. But Dragon Tales also has that [**Dragon Stone thingy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crystals/comments/qxuc9r/i_wish_i_wish_with_all_my_heart_to_fly_with/?rdt=57455)..."I wish, I wish.." 

And that flute musical in Chhota Bheem...Uff!

```{r}
#| echo: false
embedr::embed_audio("best-krishna-flute-2448.mp3")
``` 
</center>

So? Get Opinion scores from people. Scale of 10. And then? Oh, ANOVA, peasants!


## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #5: I am an INTJ

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Srishti kids are predominantly introverted
:::

What are we looking at, data-wise? A *proportion*, which if more than 50% would justify our hunch. So we do an MBTI on some unsuspecting **sample** of people, and try to generalize that result to the **population**.


## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #6: Let's Go to ChefsTouch(?)

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Most people think the food in the mess/cafeteria is ordinary.
:::
Again, a survey of a sample. Opinions, yes or no. A Proportion for the sample, and an extension to the population. A *proportion test*.

## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #7: Some people make Friends earlier. 

Let's say Art people vs Design people. Ask people if they have a BF/GF and since when...
And then a prop.test to see if there are differences in proportion.

Make sure you have equal/large nos of all genders in both groups (Art/Design).
