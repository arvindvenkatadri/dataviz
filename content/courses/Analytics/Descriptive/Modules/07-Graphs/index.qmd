## {{< fa chart-simple >}} Why Visualize?

-   We can digest information more easily when it is pictorial
-   Our [Working
    Memories](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/working-memory-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)
    are both *short-term* and *limited* in capacity. So a picture
    abstracts the details and presents us with [an overall
    summary]{style="background-color: yellow;"}, an insight, or a story
    that is both easy to recall and easy on retention.
-   Data Viz includes [*shapes* that carry strong cultural
    memories]{style="background-color: yellow;"}; and impressions for
    us. These cultural memories help us to use data viz in a *universal
    way* to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. [(Do humans have a
    gene for
    geometry?]{style="background-color: yellow;"}[^1][)]{style="background-color: yellow;"};
-   It helps sift facts from mere statements: for example:

[^1]: <https://www.xcode.in/genes-and-personality/how-genes-influence-your-math-ability/>

![Rape
Capital](../../../../../materials/images/rape-capital.png){#fig-rape-capital}

![Data Reveals
Crime](../../../../../materials/images/data-reveals-crime.png){#fig-data_reveals-crime}

- Visuals are a good starting point [to make **hypotheses**]{.black .bg-yellow} of what may be happening in the situation represented by the data

## {{< iconify bx analyse >}} Why Analyze?

- Merely looking at visualizations may not necessarily tell us the true magnitude or ***significance*** of things. 
- We need ***analytic methods or statistics*** to assure ourselves, or otherwise, of what we might suspect is happening
- These methods also help to remove human bias and ensure that we are speaking with the assurance that our problem deserves. 
- Analysis uses ***numbers, or metrics***, that allow us to crystallize our ambiguous words/guesses into quantities that can be calculated with. 
- These metrics are calculable from our data, of course, but ***are not directly visible***, despite often being intuitive.

So both visuals and analytics. And as we will see, we will not be content with that: we will visualize our analytics, and analyze our visualizations!

Let us recall first what we meant by ***tidy data***:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "680px"
#| out-height: "400px"
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: "Tidy Data"
#| label: fig-tidy-data
knitr::include_graphics("../../../../../materials/images/tidydata.jpg")

```

::: callout-important
## Tidy Data

- Each **variable** is a column; 
- Each column contains *one kind* of data.
- Each **observation** or **case** is a row.
- Each **observations** contains *one value* for each variable.
:::


## {{< iconify material-symbols auto-graph >}} What is a Data Visualization?

### {{< iconify carbon chart-network >}} Data Viz = Data + Geometry

How many *geometric things* do we know? Shapes? Lines? Axes? Curves? Angles? Patterns? Textures? Colours? Sizes? Positions? Lengths? Heights? Breadths? Radii? Textures? All these are **geometric aspects** or **aesthetics**, each with ***a unique property***. Some "geometric things" which we might consider are shown in the figure below.

![Common Geometric Aesthetics in
Charts](/content/materials/images/common-aesthetics-1.png){#fig-common-aesthetics fig-align="center"}


#### {{< iconify material-symbols function >}} Mapping

How can we ***manipulate*** these geometric aesthetics, perhaps like Kandinsky? The aesthetic has a property, an atribute, which we can manipulate in accordance with a data variable! [This act of "mapping" a **geometric thing** to a **variable**  and modifying its essential property is called Data Visualization]{style="background: yellow;"} 

For instance:

- `length` or `height` of a `bar` can be made proportional
to the`age` or `income` of a person
- `Colour` of points can be mapped to `gender`, with a unique `colour` for each `gender`. 
- `Position` along an X-axis can vary in accordance with a `height` variable, and 
- `Position` along the Y-axis can vary with a `bodyWeight` variable.

A chart may use more than one aesthetic: `position`, `shape`, `colour`,
`height` and `angle`, `pattern` or `texture` to name several. Usually,
each aesthetic is mapped to **just one** variable to ensure there is no
cognitive error. There is of course a choice and you should be able to
**map** any kind of variable to any geometric aspect/aesthetic that may
be available.

::: callout-note
### A Natural Mapping

Note that here is also a "natural" mapping between aesthetic and
**kind of variable**Quantitative or Qualitative as seen in @fig-tidy-data.
For instance, `shape` is rarely mapped to a Quantitative variable; we
understand this because the nature of variation between the Quantitative
variable and the `shape` aesthetic is not similar (i.e. not continuous).
Bad choices may lead to bad, or worse, misleading charts!

diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 150, weight_by = cut) %>% 
  gf_point(price ~ carat, colour = ~ cut, 
           shape = ~ cut, 
           size = 2, data = .) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "Plot Title = DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER", 
          subtitle = "Plot Subtitle = AND A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND",
          caption = "Plot Caption = From the diamonds dataset",
          x = "x-Axis Title = CARAT",
          y = "y-Axis Title = PRICE") %>%
  
  # Use same name for scales to merge legends
  gf_refine(scale_color_brewer(name = "Legend = DIAMOND QUALITY",
                               palette = "Set1"),
            scale_shape_manual(name = "Legend = DIAMOND QUALITY",
                               values = c(15:21)),
            
            annotate('text', x = 1.0, y = 17000, 
                     label = 'These DIAMONDS are\n Super Affordable!!',
                     fontface = 'bold', 
                     size = 3.5),
            annotate('curve',x = 0.75, 
    y = 15000,
    yend = 8000,
    xend = 0.95,
    linewidth = 1,
    curvature = +0.5,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, 'cm'))
  ),
  annotate(
    'rect',
    xmin = 1,
    xmax = 1.25,
    ymin = 2250,
    ymax = 10000,
    alpha = 0.5, 
    fill = 'grey80',
    col = 'black'
  )) 


```


In the above chart, it is pretty clear what kind of variable is plotted
on the `x-axis` and the `y-axis`. What about `colour`? Could this be
considered as **another axis** in the chart? There are also other aspects that
you can choose (not explicitly shown here) such as the
`plot theme`(colours, fonts, backgrounds etc), which may **not be
mapped** to data, but are nonetheless choices to be made. We will get
acquainted with this aspect as we build charts.

As we will see, Data Variables may be ***transformed*** before being mapped to some geometric aesthetic, e.g. we may perform ***counts*** with a Qual variable that contains ***only*** the entries `{S, M, L, XL}`. We may also transform the `axes` (make them logarithmic, or even polar ) to create precisely the shape-meaning we wish. This allows us considerable flexibility in making charts!!

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Basic Types of Charts {#sec-data-viz}

We can therefore think of simple visualizations as [combinations of aesthetics,
mapped to combinations of variables]{style="background: yellow;"}. Some
examples:

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

Let us take a look at Wickham and Grolemund's Data Science workflow picture:

![Data Science Workflow](../../../../../materials/images/workflow.svg){#fig-datascience-workflow height="240px"}

So there we have it:

-   We import and clean the data
-   Questions lead us to identify Types of Variables (Quant and Qual)\
-   Sometimes we may need to transform the data (long to wide, summarize, create new variables...)
-   Further Questions lead to *relationships* between variables, which we describe using Data Visualizations\
-   Visualizations may lead to Hypotheses, which we Analyze or Model
-   Data Visualizations are Data mapped onto Geometry 
-   Multiple Variable-to-Geometry Mappings = A Complete Data
    Visualization\
-   Which is finally Communicated


You might think of all these Questions, Answers, Mapping as being
[equivalent to **metaphors** as a language in itself]{.black .bg-yellow}. And indeed, in R we use a philosophy called the **Grammar of Graphics**! We will use this grammar in the R graphics packages that we will encounter. Other parts of the Workflow (Transformation, Analysis and Modelling) are also following similar grammars, as we shall see. 

## {{< iconify eos-icons ai >}} AI Generated Summary and Podcast

This is a tutorial on data visualization using the R programming language. It introduces concepts such as data types, variables, and visualization techniques. The tutorial utilizes metaphors to explain these concepts, emphasizing the use of geometric aesthetics to represent data. It also highlights the importance of both visual and analytic approaches in understanding data. The tutorial then demonstrates basic chart types, including histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts, and discusses the "Grammar of Graphics" philosophy that guides data visualization in R. The text concludes with a workflow diagram for data science, emphasizing the iterative process of data import, cleaning, transformation, visualization, hypothesis generation, analysis, and communication.
